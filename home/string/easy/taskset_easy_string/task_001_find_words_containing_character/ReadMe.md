# Find Words Containing A Character

[leetcode.com Â» Find words containing a character](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-words-containing-character)

## Solution

```go
func findWordsContaining(words []string, x byte) []int {
    var indices []int
    for i, word := range words {
        if strings.Contains(word, string(x)) {
            indices = append(indices, i)
        }
    }
    return indices
}
```

## Notes

1. In the function `findWordsContaining`, the second argument `x` is of type `byte` because individual characters in Go can be conveniently represented as bytes when dealing with ASCII characters. The `byte` type in Go is an alias for `uint8` and is commonly used to handle individual ASCII characters.
2. However, the `strings.Contains` function requires its second argument to be a string, not a single byte. This is why `x` needs to be converted to a string before being passed to `strings.Contains`.

## Setup

```bash
$ go mod init find_words_containing_character 
go: creating new go.mod: module find_words_containing_character
go: to add module requirements and sums:
        go mod tidy

$ go test

Example 1 - Input: [test code], Char: 'e', Expected: [0 1], Result: [0 1]    --------- Pass
Example 2 - Input: [abc bcd aaaa cbc], Char: 'a', Expected: [0 2], Result: [0 2]    --------- Pass
Example 3 - Input: [abc bcd aaaa cbc], Char: 'z', Expected: [], Result: []    --------- Pass
Overall Result
PASS
ok      find_words_containing_character 0.293s
```

## Complexity

The time complexity of the `findWordsContaining` function can be analyzed by considering the operations it performs:

1. **Iterating Over the `words` Array**:
   - The function iterates over each word in the `words` array. Let's say the length of the array is `n`.

2. **Checking if Each Word Contains the Character `x`**:
   - For each word, the function checks if it contains the character `x`. This is done using the `strings.Contains` function.
   - The complexity of `strings.Contains` depends on the length of the word it's checking. In the worst case, it might need to check each character in the word. Let's say the average length of the words in the array is `m`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n * m), where `n` is the number of words in the `words` array, and `m` is the average length of the words.
