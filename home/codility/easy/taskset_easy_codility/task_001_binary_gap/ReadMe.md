## Question

### Binary Distance Challenge

**Level**: Beginner

**Industries**: Various

#### Objective

Write a function to determine the largest gap between any two consecutive '1' bits in the binary form of a given positive integer `x`. If no consecutive '1' bits are present, the function should return 0.

The "gap" is defined as the number of bit positions between two consecutive '1' bits in the binary representation of the number. For example, in "1001", the gap between the two '1' bits is 3.

#### Scenarios

1. **Scenario 1**:
   - **Input**: `x = 13`
   - **Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: The binary form of 13 is "1101". The largest gap between consecutive '1' bits is 1.

2. **Scenario 2**:
   - **Input**: `x = 9`
   - **Output**: `3`
   - **Explanation**: The binary form of 9 is "1001". The gap between the two '1' bits is 3.

3. **Scenario 3**:
   - **Input**: `x = 20`
   - **Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: The binary form of 20 is "10100". The largest gap between consecutive '1' bits is 1.

#### Limits

- The input integer `x` will satisfy `1 <= x <= 1,000,000,000`.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we can convert the integer `N` into its binary representation and then iterate through the binary string to find the longest sequence of zeros that is flanked by ones. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Convert to Binary**: Convert the integer `N` to its binary representation.
2. **Iterate Through the Binary String**: Go through each character in the binary string.
3. **Count Zeros**: When a '1' is encountered, start counting zeros until another '1' is found.
4. **Update the Maximum Gap**: If the current gap (number of zeros between two ones) is greater than the previous maximum, update the maximum.
5. **Return the Maximum Gap**: After iterating through the entire string, return the maximum gap found.

This function should work efficiently for the given range of integers `[1..2,147,483,647]`. The time complexity is O(log N) since the binary representation of a number `N` has a length proportional to the logarithm of `N`, and the space complexity is also O(log N) due to the storage of the binary representation.

### Why use `binaryN := strconv.FormatInt(int64(N), 2)`

In Go, the `strconv.FormatInt` function requires an argument of type `int64`. If your variable `N` is declared as an `int`, which could be either `int32` or `int64` depending on the system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit), it's good practice to explicitly convert it to `int64` to ensure compatibility with the `FormatInt` function.

This conversion ensures that your program behaves consistently across different platforms, as `int` in Go is architecture dependent:

- On a 32-bit system, `int` is equivalent to `int32`.
- On a 64-bit system, `int` is equivalent to `int64`.

By explicitly converting `N` to `int64`, you make sure that the `FormatInt` function receives the correct type regardless of the underlying architecture, thereby making your code more portable. 

If `N` is already an `int64`, then the explicit conversion is not necessary, but it does not harm and makes the code more explicit and possibly clearer.

### Why us string(bit) to print Binary

In Go, when you iterate over a string with a range loop, each character (or more precisely, each rune) is represented by its Unicode code point. The Unicode code points for the characters '0' and '1' are 48 and 49, respectively, in decimal. That's why you see 48 when you print a '0' bit and 49 when you print a '1' bit. 
If you want to print the character itself ('0' or '1') rather than its Unicode code point, you need to convert the rune back into a character. This can be done simply by using the string() function to convert the rune to a string
